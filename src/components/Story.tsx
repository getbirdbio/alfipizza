            ALFI PIZZA was born from a passion to bring authentic Newhaven-style pizza to the heart of Sea Point, Cape Town. 
            Our journey began with a simple mission: to create pizzas that combine the rich tradition of New Haven, 
            Connecticut's legendary pizzerias with the vibrant flavors of the Cape.

            What makes Newhaven-style pizza special? It's all in the details - our thin-crust pizzas are coal-fired at 
            extremely high temperatures, creating that distinctive charred and crispy crust while maintaining a chewy 
            interior. We use only the finest imported Italian tomatoes and a perfect blend of cheeses, following the 
            time-honored traditions that made New Haven pizza famous worldwide.
          </p>

            Located in the bustling heart of Sea Point, ALFI PIZZA has quickly become a neighborhood favorite, 
            where locals gather to enjoy slices of authenticity in a warm, welcoming atmosphere. Each pizza is 
            crafted with care, respect for tradition, and a touch of Cape Town creativity.
